# Prop-Dekho
I have created this CRUD React app which is basically a Property management app having fully functional charts, dashboard etc. It is connected to our database which is MongoDB.
It is created using Material UI. It is developed using Typescript, Node JS, Express JS.
It also has Google Auth so users can easily Login.
